# load the deis!
Don't blindly roll the dice on course selection -- view RateMyProfessor ratings on the Brandeis University course catalog. A convenient search link embeds below the professors name, for now.

##### Planned functionality:
* link to RateMyProfessors to glean specific professor ratings to display inline on the Brandeis course catalog.

###### changelog
- _v0.1_ - added basic link embed to a search link for each professor's last name.
- _v1.0_ - added full rating display underneath professor name, with link to actual RateMyProfessor page.
- _v1.0.2_ - added manual entry for "James" as "Jim" when searching.
- _v1.0.3_ - added a little welcome note on registrar pages.

###### todo
- prepropulate the 'add ratings' page when a professor has no rating (for convenience, cuz this extension is all about that convenience, yo)
- add same functionality to brandeis.schdl.net
